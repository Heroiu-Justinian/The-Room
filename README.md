# The-Room
Yet another thing I wrote in javascript several years ago (that, in  a moment of optimism I called a game) which is supposed to be some sort of russian-anti-sleep experiment but without the anti-sleep part. It is REALLY awfully written (the amount of if's in te program is just appaling but nonetheless I had to put it on github and make it public to show myself where I was and help humble myself a little)
